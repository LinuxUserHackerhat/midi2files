I’ve never found a lover in the flesh
I cut my heart on romance plots in the movies 
And I’m not proud of my account 
Full of messed-up ships, no writer's envy
But every fic's like
Green eyes, hair loose, trippin' everywhere I go
Food fights, ball gowns, only one bed in the room
We don't care, we're eating dead doves in the street
But everybody's like
Read it, write it, write about it
Ranting, raving, sharing, reccing,
We care, we're caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be functional (adults)
We'll just go through pages, that’s enough
Normal lives just ain’t for us
Neurodivergent, unhinged fandoms crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your provider (provider)
You call me the author
And baby I’ll write (I’ll write)
Send me your wildest fantasies
My friends and I, we've cracked the code
We check our word count when we're writing
And everyone who knows us knows
We live breathe fanfic
(Oh, oh-no) The plot twist's more shocking than I ever dreamed 
And I'm in love with escaping from reality 
(AO3, AO3) 
Life is great with a new fic to read
Just one more chapter, and I'm caught up with the love affair
