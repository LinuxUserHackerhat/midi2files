I’m just a writer
With a twisted mind and I’m brainstorming, ah
Your sanity is in danger 
Come close now, let me show you the angst I wrote
Unhinged reader, you've got me running out of time to write
Reader come with me, I'll make you sob
You'll leave with a broken cry
You're a literate fool 
Who feeds me hits with those beautiful kudos
But angst aren't what they tag
So I'll let you go and weep for a while
Eager reader
You got me waking up my muse
Reader, you know I’m loving the praise
You’re gonna get an update today, yeah
You’ll wanna check back at the end of every day 
I’m giving new chapters, for you, you’ll be okay
The multiverse is yours if you just bookmark today
Baby, won't you read this AU I made
Dear reader 
You got me writing like Shakespeare style
Baby I'm in iambic pentameter over your smile
You're gonna get an update today
Meager sleep,
Fics keeping me up all night
Web spinner, keep the pulls and ties tight
I’m in for the long ride, 
yeah
